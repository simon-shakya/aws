# Lex-Lambda-RDS Demo

In this demo you will be creating a Lex bot that will be used to make an appointment for your pet to take it to the grooming salon. You will also build a simple Lambda function that will be used as backend for the Lex bot. This function will also be used to insert the appointment information into a RDS database. Lastly, you will deploy a simple web application using App Runner service that will be used to review and cancel the appointments.

The demo is dividen in 6 stages:

- Stage 1 - Create the ECR repository and create the Lambda function
- Stage 2 - Create the RDS database
- Stage 3 - Build the Docker image, create Parameter Store entries and set up RDS database
- Stage 4 - Create and configure the Lex bot
- Stage 5 - Deploy the application using App Runner
- Stage 6 - Test the bot and review the appointments
- Stage 7 - Clean up

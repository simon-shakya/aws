# Lex-Lambda-RDS Demo

In this part of the DEMO, you will be testing the application.

# STAGE 6 - Test the bot and review the appointments

After some minutes, you should see the service **"animal-grooming"** with the status **""Running"** in the **"Service overview"** section.

Click on the **"Default domain"** link located in the **"Service overview"** section to open the web application. You should see a web application with no appointments.

Now we are going to test the bot to create some appointments.

Navigate to the Lex V2 console: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/home?region=us-east-1

Click on the **"AppointmentBot"** bot. Then, click on the **"Intents"** option.

Click on the **"Test"** button located in the top right corner of the page. A pop-up window will appear with a chatbot interface.

Now you can interact with the bot to create appointments. You can use the following messages as examples:

- `Book an appointment on Friday at 10:00 AM`
- `I need to schedule a grooming session for my cat`
- `I want to make a pet grooming reservation`

After you have created some appointments via the bot, you can change to the tab with the web application and refresh the page. You should see the appointments that you have created. You can also cancel the appointments by clicking on the **"Cancel"** button.
